            <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio.</h2>
            <p>My name is Reitumetse Makhathe, a web journalist with expertise in creating engaging multimedia content. I offer services in podcast production, video editing, and live broadcasting. I aim to inform and entertain my audience through compelling storytelling. Based in Mafeteng, I collaborate with clients worldwide. I've written for a number of magazines and newspapers - both local and international, print and digital. I've also launched and edited magazines, commissioned other creatives, managed teams, budgets and publishing schedules. I love to write about a variety of subjects but have a special interest in talking to individuals, brands and organisations who are making a positive impact on people and the planet. I have about five years of working experience. After finishing my MA Journalism at the university of Free State, South Africa, I worked at a local broadcaster for a while. I learned a lot and got a lot of opportunities 'in the field', but I realised I wanted more freedom. That's why I started freelancing. I'm especially interested in nature, sustainability, social issues, and travel. If you're interested in working with me, don't hesitate to shoot me a message.</p>

                <p>Welcome! I’m Reitumetse Makhathe, a web journalist dedicated to uncovering stories that matter and presenting them in a way that engages, informs, and resonates with audiences worldwide. My journey began with a fascination for storytelling, whether through the written word, visuals, or audio. Early in my career, I worked as a traditional journalist, focusing on news articles and editorials. But as the digital landscape evolved, I felt drawn to explore new media and embrace the power of multimedia storytelling. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in various areas of digital journalism, from podcast production and video editing to live-streaming events and social media storytelling. I believe that today’s stories deserve a multi-dimensional approach, where every medium is leveraged to its fullest potential, whether it’s a podcast that dives deep into trending topics, a video breaking down complex issues, or a live broadcast keeping viewers informed in real-time. One of my core motivations is to craft content that’s not just informative but also thought-provoking.</p>
